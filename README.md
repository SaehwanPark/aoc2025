# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 Solutions (in F\#)

This repository contains my solutions for the **Advent of Code 2025** challenges, implemented in **F\#** using the latest **.NET 10** runtime.

-----

## 📅 The 12-Day Challenge

Starting this year, the challenge runs for **12 days**, from **December 1st through December 12th**.

  * **Official Website:** [https://adventofcode.com/2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

-----

## 💻 Repository Structure

This repository is organized to separate the code, input data, and analysis:

  * **`scripts/`**: Contains the F\# script files (`.fsx`) for each day's solution (e.g., `day01.fsx`).
  * **`inputs/`**: Holds the personalized input files for each puzzle (e.g., `day01.txt`).
  * **`analyses/`**: A place for algorithm analysis, development notes, and solution sketches (e.g., Markdown or text files).

## 🛠 Running the Solutions (F\# / .NET 10)

To run these F\# scripts, you'll need the **[.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)** (or newer) installed.

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the `.NET 10 SDK` installed.
2.  **Run a script:** Navigate to the root directory and use the `dotnet fsi` command to execute an individual solution:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
# Replace XX with the day number (e.g., 01, 02, etc.)
dotnet fsi scripts/dayXX.fsx
```

> **Note:** The scripts are designed to read their puzzle input from the **`inputs/`** directory.
